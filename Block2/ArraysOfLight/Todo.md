# what to do </P>

Create a 2D array that's filled with bacteria. Every round simulate the Bacteria's moves.  
Every 5 rounds the bacteria reproduces, and mutates.
Bacteria takes damage every turn it isn't eating. Eating food restores health.
Bacteria can move a either 1 or âˆš2 spaces every turn, or they can attack.  
When Bacteria Attacks, the Bacteria with the higher speed stat attacks first, when a Bacteria's health reaches 0, it dies.  
  
I imagine that this will very quickly (d)evolve into Bacteria with max stats, so I'll have to find a way to prevent Bacteria from getting too strong.
