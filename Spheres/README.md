a simple graphics experiment. I don't really like Java graphics that much, but I'm forced to this time. Balls can be dynamically added. 
The collision system isn't the best considering it loops through a loop and uses the Pythagorean Theorem in order to calculate distance, it should be spiral search but it's really not that big of a deal.
You can type 1-9 and spawn the associated amount of balls.
