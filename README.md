# javatest
A compilation of simple experiement born from playing with Java for the first few times.

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code. I don't know why you'd want anything to do with it, it's quite bad, but if you're bored and want to try fixing it, be my guest. 

Perhaps you've found a solution to what you're doing here. I hope not, this is quite bad, but if it works, it works.

Originally programmed in BlueJ & VSCode.
