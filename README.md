A complilation of my High School AP Computer Science Class's assignments. The course has since concluded. These are my attempts at completing the assignments.

I've divided these up into Semiester blocks.

## Semester 1
1. RudimentaryCalculator  
As the name would imply. A bad double calculator.  
  
2. ChangeMaker  
Returns change.  
  
3. OK I Guess  
A simple game where a player can enter 3 guesses and guess a 1-100 chance. Closest wins.  
  
4. If it ships it fits  
Checks if a package based on dimensions is ok to ship, must not be too big or too heavy.  
  
5. Fairground  
A bunch of text based minigames.  
  
6. Looping for Awhile  
Intro to loops. Each method utalizes a loop.  
  
7. APCSLand  
A weird dice game.  
  
8. Array of Light  
Intro to Arrays. Input an array and get it analyzed on a few different things.  
  
9. Spheres  
Intro to Java graphics using JFrame as a base. Just some bouncing balls.  
  
10. Terraria Name Generator  
This one wasn't actually required I just did this for giggles one morning. Ironically I could reuse this for a later project.  
  
11. Baby Game  
Making a game out of intro graphics knowledge. Hated this one.  
  
12. Dreamscape  
Spheres on steroids.  
  
13. Franken Scentence  
Intro to Strings. Terraria Name Generator but after Terraria Name Generator but a bit more complex and actually required.  
  
14. Fauxku  
Janky Haiku generator. Follows the fake "5, 7, 5" but has no checks for coherancy.  
  
15. Pig Latin Palindrome  
Translates English into Pig Latin. Also checks if it's a Palindrome.  
  
16. Text Analyzer  
Imports a formated text file and analyzes it.  
  
## Semester 2
1. ThreeSorts  
Generates a random Array and then sorts it with the 3 worst sorting methods. Bubble, Selection and Insertion Sort.  
  
2. Gridworld (bugs)  
Intro to inheritance. Built off of an existing framework, the requirement is to make new types of bug behaviour.  
  
3. Recursion  
A few basic methods that uses Recursion to solve some Math Equations.  

This is public as I hope to detail my "journey" from a fairly incompitent programmer, to a competent programmer. And who knows, maybe you'll learn something too.  

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code. I don't know why you'd want anything to do with it, it's quite bad, but if you're bored and want to try fixing it, be my guest. Perhaps you've found a solution to what you're doing here. I hope not, this is quite bad, but if it works, it works.  

this code sucks because:
1. It doesn't implement any __SOLID__, __OOD__ or any kind of design principles.
2. Overuse of Switch statements when a Hashmap would be better.
3. Use of For Loops instead of inbuilt functions for simple tasks. (ex. IndexOf/Substring)
4. Overly long lines and God Objects.
5. Lack of localized values, instead opting for monstrously long if statements/other checks.
6. Obsession with making short classes even shorter, readability be damned (I have stopped doing this)
7. God Objects/Managers.
8. "Feeder Classes" which only exist because of poor planning regarding side stepping static limitations.
9. Static neglect (been using it more in Semiester 2)
10. Misuse of Inheritance
11. Leaving Raws (mostly from Gridworld)
12. Lack of Anon Functions
13. Not using any standard for variable naming conventions.

I don't do all of these as much anymore, but they're still present in places  

Originally programmed in BlueJ & VSCode.
