# javatest
A compilation of simple experiement born from playing with Java for the first few times in my Computer Science class. These are just my attempts at completing the labs.  

I've divided these up into Semiester blocks.  

## Semiester 1
1. RudimentaryCalculator
2. ChangeMaker
3. OK I Guess
4. If it ships it fits
5. Fairground
6. Looping for Awhile
7. APCSLand
8. Array of Light
9. Spheres
10. Terraria Name Generator
11. Baby Game
12. Dreamscape
13. Franken Scentence
14. Fauxku
15. Pig Latin Palindrome
16. Text Analyzer

## Semiester 2
1. ThreeSorts
2. Gridworld (bugs)

### These will not be updated after they're done unless something really bothers me.

This is public as I hope to detail my "journey" from a fairly incompitent programmer, to a competent programmer. And who knows, maybe you'll learn something too.  

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code. I don't know why you'd want anything to do with it, it's quite bad, but if you're bored and want to try fixing it, be my guest. Perhaps you've found a solution to what you're doing here. I hope not, this is quite bad, but if it works, it works.  

this code sucks because:
1. It doesn't implement any __SOLID__, __OOD__ or any kind of design principles.
2. Overuse of Switch statements when a Hashmap would be better.
3. Use of For Loops instead of inbuilt functions for simple tasks. (ex. IndexOf/Substring)
4. Overly long lines and God Objects.
5. Lack of localized values, instead opting for monstrously long if statements/other checks.
6. Obsession with making short classes even shorter, readability be damned (I have stopped doing this)
7. God Objects/Managers.
8. "Feeder Classes" which only exist because of poor planning regarding side stepping static limitations.
9. Static neglect (been using it more in Semiester 2)
10. Misuse of Inheritance
11. Leaving Raws (mostly from Gridworld)
12. Lack of Anon Functions
13. Not using any standard for variable naming conventions.

I don't do all of these as much anymore, but they're still present in places  

Originally programmed in BlueJ & VSCode.
