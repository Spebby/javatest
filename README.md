# javatest
A compilation of simple experiement born from playing with Java for the first few times in my Computer Science class. These are just my attempts at completing the labs.

I've divided these up into Semiester blocks.

## Semiester 1
1. RudimentaryCalculator
2. ChangeMaker
3. OK I Guess
4. If it ships it fits
5. Fairground
6. Looping for Awhile
7. APCSLand
8. Array of Light
9. Spheres
10. Terraria Name Generator
11. Baby Game
12. Dreamscape
13. Franken Scentence
14. Fauxku
15. Pig Latin Palindrome
16. Text Analyzer

## Semiester 2
1. ThreeSorts
2. Gridworld (bugs)

### These will not be updated after they're done unless something really bothers me.

This is public as I hope to detail my "journey" from a fairly incompitent programmer, to a competent programmer. And who knows, maybe you'll learn something too.

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code. I don't know why you'd want anything to do with it, it's quite bad, but if you're bored and want to try fixing it, be my guest. Perhaps you've found a solution to what you're doing here. I hope not, this is quite bad, but if it works, it works.

Let me break down specifically why this code sucks. 
1. It doesn't implement any __SOLID__ or __OOD__ principles (at least not on purpose) until *at least* "Spheres". 
2. Overuse of Switch statements when a Hashmap would be better
3. Use of For Loops instead of inbuilt functions for simple tasks (ex. IndexOf/Substring)
4. Overly long lines and God Objects
5. Obsession with making short classes have less lines no matter how much it destroys readability (i have stopped doing this)
6. Limited Cargo Cult Programming (cobbled together from stack overflow results online, modified a fair amount of it myself or rewrote it, but there are some cases in the code)
7. God Objects/Managers
8. Feeder Classes to side step Static restrictions
9. Never using Static (even when it would be beneficial to use them)
10. Misuse of Inheritance
11. someother stuff idk

Originally programmed in BlueJ & VSCode.
