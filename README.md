# javatest
A compilation of simple experiement born from playing with Java for the first few times in my Computer Science class. These are just my attempts at completing the labs.
Order of experiments:
1. RudimentaryCalculator
2. ChangeMaker
3. OK I Guess
4. If it ships it fits
5. Fairground
6. Looping for Awhile
7. APCSLand
8. Array of Light

### These will not be updated after they're done unless something really bothers me.

This is public as I hope to detail my "journey" from a fairly incompitent programmer, to a competent programmer. And who knows, maybe you'll learn something too.

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code. I don't know why you'd want anything to do with it, it's quite bad, but if you're bored and want to try fixing it, be my guest. Perhaps you've found a solution to what you're doing here. I hope not, this is quite bad, but if it works, it works.

Originally programmed in BlueJ & VSCode.
